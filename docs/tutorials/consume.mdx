In this tutorial, we learn how to Consume services running in a Teamspace. If you recall, the following diagram represents our Application Service Graph running in Kubernetes:

<Architecture />

## Desired Environment

Let us assume you wish to make changes to the Frontend service. We can see from the diagram above that the Frontend Service requires the Sockets and the Core services. In order to develop locally, you would not only have to run the Sockets and Core service locally but the entire blast radius of upstream services. In this case, this includes Database and Leaf even though Frontend does not directly require this.

Instead, given that we have a Teamspace with these services running, we would like to do the following:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Kubernetes
    direction LR
    User(Ingress) --- |HTTP /| Frontend((Frontend))
    Frontend ---|Websocket| Sockets((Sockets))
    Frontend --- |HTTP|Core((Core))
    Core ---|TCP| Database[(Database)]
    Core ---|HTTP| Leaf((Leaf))
    User --- |HTTP /api| Core
    end

    subgraph Local
    Local-Frontend[Frontend] -.->|Websocket| Sockets((Sockets))
    Local-Frontend -.-> |HTTP|Core((Core))
    end
```

We say that we would like to _Consume_ the Core and Sockets services. Concretely, we would like to be able to run the following `curl` or `websocat` commands and retrieve data from these services as though they were running locally:

```bash
curl -L http://sample-project-core.sample-project:3000/api
```

```bash
websocat -v ws://sample-project-sockets.sample-project:8999/
```

Note how the service names match the service names in-cluster: `<service-name>.<namespace-name>`

## Local Development with Consume

In order to consume, run the following command:

```bash
czctl consume edit
```

When the text editor pops up, enter the following consume rule, then save and close the editor:

```
sample-project/sample-project-core
sample-project/sample-project-sockets
```

You can now see which services are available locally using

```bash
czctl consume list
```

and your output will looks something like the following:

```
sample-project/sample-project-core (sessions: 1)
  ‣ 01H8X4DCNFYCW2PZV0V77NCMXR:sample-project:sample-project-core:3000
    Resource: sample-project-core
    Namespace: sample-project
    Port: 3000
    Status: enabled

sample-project/sample-project-sockets (sessions: 1)
  ‣ 01H8X4DCNFYCW2PZV0V77NCMXR:sample-project:sample-project-sockets:8999
    Resource: sample-project-sockets
    Namespace: sample-project
    Port: 8999
    Status: enabled
```

:::note
Make sure you have run `czctl start` now if you have not already
:::

You can now test to see if these services are available locally using either of the `curl` or `websocat` commands above.

Now you could have accomplished the above using `kubectl port-forward ...` however, here are some reasons to use `czctl consume` instead of `kubectl port-forward`


### Advantages over port-forwarding
Advantages over using port-forward include:
1. You do not need to have access to Kubernetes credentials (Kubeconfig)
1. Port-forwarding binds to Pods whereas Codezero routes to Services which means:
    1. You get the real round-robin experience that the Frontend service gets in cluster
    1. Pods can crash or restart and you will not have to re-establish your port-forward
1. You get to use the proper in-cluster DNS name of the Socket and Core services instead of `localhost`
1. Consume uses far fewer resources and is much more performant when trying to consume many services within a cluster

### Cleaning up

In order to close your consume sessions, run:

```bash
czctl consume edit
```

and this time clear all the lines in the file. Your consume sessions will close.


### Using Wildcards in Rules

As your application grows, your list of services can become unmanageable. In this case, you can use the `*` wildcard in the consume rules list.

This time, when you run `czctl consume edit`, try the following rule:

```
sample-project/*
```

This time, all the services in the `sample-project` namespace are available locally so the following command will allow you to connect to the Database service:

```bash
mongosh "mongodb://sample-project-database.sample-project:27017"
```

### Using Negation in Rules

When running services locally, developers often start servers on `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` which binds to all interfaces. This can result in port conflicts. Often times, when developing a services, you do not want to consume the in-cluster variant of the service. You can add a negation rules to the consume rule set to exclude specific services:

```
sample-project/*
!sample-project/sample-project-frontend
```

The above rule set will consume all services in the `sample-project` namespace except for the `sample-project-core` service.

### Selecting a Primary Namespace

Kubernetes services can access services across namespaces. The following defines all valid names for a Kubernetes service.

```
service-name
service-name.namespace
service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

Consume supports all of the above permutations however, in order to use the simple form `service-name`, we need to designate a *Primary Namespace*. This is because service names are not unique across namespaces. The Primary Namespace makes the `namespace` optional so you can address the service by its `service-name` as if your local machine is running inside the cluster and within the same namespace.

To select the Primary Namespace, run:

```bash
czctl primary-namespace select sample-project
```

Now, note that you no longer have to specify the namespace when using `curl` or other tools:


```bash
curl -L http://sample-project-core:3000/api
```

```bash
websocat -v ws://sample-project-sockets:8999/
```
