# Installing Space Agent using Terraform

## How to Install the Space Agent using Terraform


The easiest is to use the Terraform Helm Provider to install the Helm chart.
The full configuration options for our Helm chart are here: [https://github.com/c6o/helm-charts](https://github.com/c6o/helm-charts?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-options)

At minimum you need to set those three options:

```yaml
org.apikey: your-org-api-key
org.id: your-org-id
space.name: name-of-teamspace
```
You can get the first two variables in the Hub here: [https://hub.codezero.io/api-keys](https://hub.codezero.io/api-keys)

Alternatively, you also have the option to put the API Key and Org ID in a Kubernetes secret. To store these in a k8s Secret, you need to set org.secret to the name of the secret. 

The secret must contain two keys **CZ_HUB_ORG_ID** and **CZ_HUB_ORG_APIKEY**.

After the Helm Chart installs the Space Agent, the Space Agent will register itself with the API key and Org ID under the given *space.name*. 
When successfully registered, the Teamspace will appear in the [Codezero Hub](https://hub.codezero.io/teamspaces).

When you uninstall the Helm Chart, the Space Agent will remove the Teamspace registration from the Hub.
