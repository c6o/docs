# Installing Local Agent

Codezero's developer tools help in the development and testing of Kubernetes applications through a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a web application.

<AppInstall />

## Requirements

<AppRequirements />

## Install Only the Codezero CLI

If you are in a headless environment, or don't want to install the Desktop GUI, you can run:

```bash
brew install c6o/codezero/codezero
```

to install a headless version of the tool, which only includes the `czctl` CLI and background services.
