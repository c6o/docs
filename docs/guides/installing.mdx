# Installing Local Agent

Codezero's developer tools help in the development and testing of Kubernetes applications through a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a web application.

To install Codezero via the command line, run:

```bash
brew install c6o/tap/codezero
```

## Requirements

Codezero requires:

- MacOS or Ubuntu 18.x+ to run the CLI (`czctl`)
- `sudo`/`root` permissions on your local system
