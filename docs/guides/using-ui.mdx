# Using the UI

import ServiceCatalogImg from './_media/service_catalog.png'

The Codezero Hub has a built in UI that is twofold. The Hub is where one can provision Teamspaces but also holds the Service Catalog where developers can Consume services as well as Serve up Variants.

The following image highlights elements of the Service Catalog UI:


<div class="text--center">
  <img width="80%" src={ServiceCatalogImg}/>
</div>

:::info
In order to see the Servcice Catalog you need to have `czctl` running on your local machine.  See [Initialize the CLI](/guides/using-cli#initialize-the-cli).
