# Mounting an In-Cluster Volume

When using Codezero to consume a remote service, traffic is intercepted and sent to the local process. But let's say you have a kubernetes operator which depends on a resource in a mounted directory in the cloud - like a storage class files needed to execute. To allow the consumed process access to the files on the remote volume follow these steps.

Here's the procedure using an NFS Mount:

1. Copy the following sample yaml from our [c6o/sample-project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c6o/sample-project/main/k8s/nfs/core.yaml) repo
2. Modify lines 40 and 50 to match your persistentVolumeClaim [PVC] and also match all the namespaces
3. Apply the file and make sure the NFS Pod starts properly
4. Run `czctl consume edit` and enter `<namespace>/nfs-mount`
5. For convenience, make the namespace the primary namespace `czctl primary-namespace select <namespace>`
6. You should be able to now mount the volume locally using NFS `mount -t nfs nfs-mount:/usr/src/app/data ~/mnt`


The above assumes you want the path `/usr/src/app/data` (defined in the yaml) and that you have a local mountpoint `~/mnt`

For more resiliency, you can use a Deployment instead of a Pod. Codezero tunnels to the Service (not the Pod) so the above will work even a single NFS Pod fails.
