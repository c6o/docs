Codezero’s Serve function allows developers to run a service locally while making it appear as if it’s deployed in the Kubernetes cluster. When you serve a local variant, you can:

- Route specific traffic to your local service instance while keeping cluster traffic undisturbed
- Test changes without deploying to the cluster
- Share your local variant with team members through the service catalog

## Variants

A Variant in Codezero represents an alternative instance of a service that can run alongside the default in-cluster version.
Unlike traditional versioning, variants allow developers to test changes without deployment while allowing the original service to function undisturbed.

### Traffic Management

- Multiple variants can coexist simultaneously
- Traffic can be selectively routed based on:
  - User ID
  - Custom headers
  - [W3C Baggage](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/), for example [OpenTelemetry Baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/) or [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/trace_context_propagation/#baggage)

### Collaboration Features

- Team members can see available variants in the service catalog
- Developers can choose between original services or colleague’s variants
- Multiple developers can work on different variants of the same service simultaneously

## Benefits

Serving variants enables developers to test changes in a production-like environment without deployment overhead, facilitating faster development cycles and reducing the complexity of microservice development.
