# Advanced Consume Topics

## Using Wildcards in Rules

As your application grows, your list of services can become unmanageable. In this case, you can use the `*` wildcard in the consume rules list.

When you run `czctl consume edit` or edit the consume rules in the app, try the following rule:

```
*.my-namespace
```

This time, all the services in the `my-namespace` namespace are available locally.

### Using Negation in Rules

When running services locally, developers often start servers on `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` which binds to all interfaces.
This can result in port conflicts. Often times, when developing a services, you do not want to consume the in-cluster variant of the service.
You can add a negation rules to the consume rule set to exclude specific services:

```
*.my-namespace
!frontend.my-namespace
```

The above rule set will consume all services in the `my-namespace` namespace except for the `frontend` service.

## Cleaning up

In order to close your consume sessions, run:

```bash
czctl consume clear
```

Your consume sessions will close.


## Selecting a Primary Namespace

Kubernetes services can access services across namespaces. The following defines all valid names for a Kubernetes service.

```
service-name
service-name.my-namespace
service-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

Consume supports all of the above permutations however, to use the simple form `service-name`, we need to designate a *Primary Namespace*.
This is because service names are not unique across namespaces. The Primary Namespace makes the `my-namespace` optional so you can address the service by its `service-name` as if your local machine is running inside the cluster and within the same namespace.

To select the Primary Namespace, run:

```bash
czctl primary-namespace select my-namespace
```

Now you no longer have to specify the namespace when accessing services.
