* Local Agents below version 2.6.0 cannot connect to the Space Agents 2.7.0 and above.
* **We strongly recommend updating your Local Agents of all developers to version 2.7.0 _before_ updating your Space Agents to avoid connectivity interruptions.**

:::

### Local Agent

* New [Desktop Application](/getting-started/installation#desktop-application) which provides:

  * Quick access to the Service Catalog
  * Easy Consume All / Clear button (blue)
  * Fast filtering for Namespace & Services at top of screen
  * Quick Switch between Teamspaces
  * Organization access (if you belong to more than one Codezero Org)
  * _Easy_ Test connect to Variants+ - (one-click copy of curl command when clicking on a userâ€™s Variant in the Service Catalog)

* The Daemon now runs as a background service and is automatically started on startup.
* New CLI commands: `czctl consume all`, `czctl consume clear`, `czctl daemon` and `czctl services list`.
  * `czctl services list` provides your cluster service details in the terminal!
* Deprecated commands: `czctl options` and `czctl organization clear`.
* Improved connection stability.

### Space Agent

* The Operator is now enabled by default.
* The Space Agent requires fewer resources. It now only consists of System and Operator (Orchestrator has been removed).

### How to Install Desktop App using CLI?

The Desktop App contains the binary for the CLI. If you have installed the CLI via homebrew, simply run the following commands to uninstall the previous CLI czctl and install the new Desktop App:
