To install the full Desktop application and CLI, visit our [Getting Started](https://www.codezero.io/get-started) page, and install the appropriate installer for your Operating System.

Alternatively, to install CodeZero via the command line, run:

```bash
curl -L https://releases.codezero.io/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

:::tip

If you want to play around with pre-releases, you can install canary releases using: `curl -sL https://releases.codezero.io/install.sh | /bin/bash -s -- canary`. A word of caution, however, as canary releases have not been fully tested and may cause unexpected behavior.
