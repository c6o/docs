# Getting Help

We love hearing from Developers! Feedback from developers like you significantly influences our product roadmap. Without your feedback, our team is relegated to long and drawn out meetings where we debate each other's ill-conceived opinions. Take it from us, we would rather be working on your request.

## Community and Support

If none of the resources below address your need or if you need any help to get started with Codezero, please reach out to our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/wx3JkVjTPy) or our developer support team at [support@codezero.io](mailto:support@codezero.io)
