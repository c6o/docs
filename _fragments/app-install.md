```bash
brew install c6o/tools/cz
```

You can also use npm to install the cli:
```bash
npm install -g @c6o/app
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to use `sudo npm install -g @c6o/cz` if your current user doesn't have permission to the installation folders.

> [!WIP]
> Yarn currently does not work to install CodeZero's App, please use homebrew or npm.
