# About Us #

[whatiscodezero](../../_fragments/whatiscodezero.md ':include')

CodeZero builds on top of the great work done at [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [Docker](http://docker.com) and [Istio](http://istio.io). Key to the CodeZero toolset is enabling developers to close the develop/debug loop by running and testing their code in their local development environment they love, but with the same context and access as though they are actually running in-cluster.

CodeZero takes a developer and user-centric view to cluster computing while maintaining DevOps control over the aspects that they :heart: and are accustomed to.

We have taken care to reuse what is already available so you can leverage your investment in these excellent technologies.
