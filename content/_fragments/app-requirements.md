CodeZero requires:

- MacOS or Ubuntu 18.x+ to run the full Desktop GUI
- MacOS, Linux, or Windows 10+ with WSL2 to run the CLI (`czctl`)
- `sudo`/`root` permissions on your local system

> [!NOTE]
> Running the CodeZero CLI on Windows requires WSL2. Instructions on setting up WSL2 can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

> [!WIP]
> The Desktop GUI is currently unavailble on Windows/WSL2. We expect to address this soon, as [WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg), becomes more common.
