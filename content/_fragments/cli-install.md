```bash
brew install c6o/tools/czctl
```

You can also use npm to install the cli:
```bash
npm install -g @c6o/cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to use `sudo npm install -g @c6o/cli` if your current user doesn't have permission to the installation folders.

> [!WIP]
> Yarn currently does not work to install the cli, please use homebrew or npm.
