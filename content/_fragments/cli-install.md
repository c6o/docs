```bash
brew install c6o/tools/czctl
```

Or, you can run:

```bash
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl https://storage.googleapis.com/c6o-releases/install-headless.sh)"
```

> [!PROTIP]
> If you want to play around with pre-releases, you can install our canary version using: `brew install c6o/tools/czctl-canary`.  But bewarned, it has not been fully tested and may cause unexpected behaviour.
