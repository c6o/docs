# Application Manifest

> [!WIP]
> This document is still being developed and may be incomplete.

The application manifest is a yaml definition file that describes all the attributes of an application and how it interacts with CodeZero.  Namely, it covers:

1. how it is displayed in the Marketplace,
2. what is used to perform provisioning and management,
3. how it behaves in the Marina, and
4. how CodeZero exposes the service to the world.

## Publishing

Using the Application Manifest, an Application developer can publish and update applications directly to the CodeZero Marketplace.

```bash
czctl app publish path/to/manifest.yaml
```
