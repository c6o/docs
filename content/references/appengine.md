# App Engine

> [!WIP]
> This document is still being developed and may be incomplete.

App Engine is a highly configurable provisioner created by CodeZero that provides developers with a fast and easy way to onboard their applications without needing to create a customer provisioner of their own.

> [!NOTE]
> Check out the [Creating a Basic Application Guide](../guide/1-basic) to see App Engine in action.

## When to use App Engine

App Engine is intended to support the most common application use-cases. It is ideal for any application that:

1. is contained in a single docker image,
2. exposes any number of TCP or HTTP endpoints,
3. is configurable using Environment variables, and
4. only requires basic user interaction/input during installation.

### Not supported

App Engine does not cover every possible use-case though (yet).  In the event an application needs more functionality than App Engine supports, a custom Provisioner will need to be created.

A custom provisioner may be required for any applications that:

* have multiple pods and/or containers per application,
* need advanced user interaction during the installation process,
* need to run as a Stateful Set, or other advanced Kubernetes resources,
* link to other CodeZero applications, or
* expose a custom API for other applications

## Provisioner Specification

All the configuration for an App Engine application is stored in the provisioner spec of the [Application Manifest](./application-manifest.md#Provisioner-Spec).

```yaml
name: packageName
package: @provisioner/appengine
# ... other Application Manifest properties go here
editions:
- name: preview
  spec:
    # ... routes, marina, etc
    provisioner:
      package: @provisioner/appengine
      name: nodered
      image: nodered/node-red
      automated: true
      ports: 
      - port: 1880
        type: tcp
      # ... other App Engine Spec Goes here
```

### App Engine Spec

| Property         | Value(s)               | Default  | Description
| --------         | --------               | -------  | -----------
| name             | String                 | REQUIRED | Internal application name
| image            | String                 | REQUIRED | Docker image name.  Can also include tag  (ex: `image:latest`)
| package          | String                 | REQUIRED | Must alwyas be set to `@provisioner/appengine` when using App Engine.
| automated        | Boolean                | REQUIRED | For now, this property should always be set to true.
| ports            | [Port](#Port)[]   | []       | List of ports to expose for the application
| configs          | [Config](#Config)[] | []       | Container environment variables
| secrets          | [Secret](#Secret)[] | []       | List of Secret environment variables
| volumes          | [Volume](#Volume)[] | []       | List of Volume Mounts

> [!PROTIP]
> If your service only exposes a single HTTP endpoint, you can specify a port, which just takes an integer for the port (ex: `port: 8080`).

### Config

| Property | Value(s) | Default  | Description

| label    | String   |          | Text label displayed to the user during installation.
| hint     | String   |          | A text hint displayed to the user during installation.
| fieldType | String  |          | Field type to display to user.  Currently supports 'text' or 'password'.  If empty, the user will not be prompted for this field.  (NOTE if you select password, you should probably consider having this stored as a secret as well)
