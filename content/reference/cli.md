<a name="auth" id="auth"></a>
## czctl auth

```bash
czctl auth login
czctl auth logout
```

<a name="install" id="install"></a>
## czctl install

```bash
czctl install APPNAME [OPTIONS]
```

<a name="provision" id="provision"></a>
## czctl provision

```bash
czctl provision PATH [--package SRC_DIR] [OPTIONS]
```

To configure and run a provisioner from the CLI, the user creates a file containing an application spec and runs the provisioner.

If there are options not specified either on the command line, or in the application spec, the provisioner will prompt the user to supply values.

<a name="uninstall" id="uninstall"></a>
## czctl uninstall

```bash
czctl uninstall APPNAME [OPTIONS]
```

This will look for an application in the cluster. If there is more than one with this name the CLI will prompt for a namespace if required.

If there are deprovisioning options that are available but not specified in the manifest or on the command line, the CLI will prompt.

<a name="update" id="update"></a>
## czctl update

```bash
czctl update PATH [OPTIONS]
```

<a name="publish" id="publish"></a> 
## czctl publish

```bash
czctl publish PATH [OPTIONS]
```
