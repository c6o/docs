# About Us

CodeZero builds on top of the great work done at [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [Docker](http://docker.com) and [Istio](http://istio.io). Key to the CodeZero toolset is enabling developers to close the develop/debug loop by running and testing their code in their local development environment they love, but with the same context and access as though they are actually running in-cluster.

CodeZero strives to deliver an excellent Development experience and to keep things simple for those of us who are new to or do not know much about Kubernetes. We also believe in empowering experienced DevOps teams to support their development teams and have a clear understanding of what our tools are doing to local and in-cluster resources.

We have taken care to reuse what is already available, so you can leverage your investment in these excellent technologies.
