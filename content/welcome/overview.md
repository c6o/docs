[whatiscodezero](../_fragments/whatiscodezero.md ':include')

CodeZero takes a developer and user centric view to cluster computing while mainting DevOps control over the aspects that they :heart: and are accustomed to.

We have taken care to reuse what is already available so you can leverage your investment in these excellent technologies.

## Our Values ##

These core values help guide the overall architecture of CodeZero.

* Deliver an excellent development experience
* Leverage and contribute to existing open source technologies
* Provide a seamless experience throughout the development lifecycle
* Allow you to use CodeZero on your cloud provider of choice:
  * Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Google Cloud
  * DigitalOcean
  * Minikube
  * Just-a-bunch-of-Machines (JBOMs)

## Code Zero Platform

Over time, traditional Operating Systems have gone from handling single CPU computers, to multi-core processors and now, any number of CPU and GPU combinations. At CodeZero, we asked ourselves what this means in the age of Cloud Computing.

Just as Operating systems abstract away low level aspects of underlying computing hardware for applications and services, CodeZero provides an OS-like abstraction for cloud applications.

Fortunately there is a good deal of technology already developed to help manage clusters of computers. Technologies such as [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [Istio](http://istio.io) and [Docker](http://docker.com) have made it much easier to manage and orchestrate a cluster of machines.

Despite that, we felt there was more that can be done to improve the overall experience.
