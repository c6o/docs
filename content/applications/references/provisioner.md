# Provisioner API

## ProvisionerManager

The ProvisionManager creates provisioner objects, and holds the state of provisioning.  It provides access to several APIs used by provisioners:

### Fields

* `document` - application document that is being created, updated or removed
* `status` - Status API to provide real time status while provisioning, also used by the cluster API
* `inquirer` - [inquirer API](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme) to interact with the CLI
* `cluster` - [KubeClient API](/references/kubeclient.md)
* `state` - map for storing data between provisioning stages

### Methods

* `getInstalledApps(name)` - get installed app specs for applications on the cluster with the specified name
* `getInstalledApp(name, namespace)` - get installed app spec for the specified app name and namespace
* `getProvisioner(appDoc: AppDocument)` - get the provisioner for the specified app spec
* `getAppProvisioner(name, namespace)` - get the provisioner for the application with the specified name and namespace
* `getInstalledServices(serviceName)` - get the applications in the cluster that advertise the specified service

## Provisioner Base Class

Provisioners extend the ProvisionerBase typically using mixins.  The Base class provides the following fields and methods.

### Fields

* `manager` - access to the ProvisionerManager that created the Provisioner.
* `spec` - the provisioner section of the application (or service section of the application for the provisioner)

### Methods

* `ensureNamespaceExists()` - ensure the target namespace for an application exists, and if not, create it.
* `serviceNamespace` - the target namespace for creating apps

## Provisioner Web Component APIs

### Mediator

The mediator is used by the install and uninstall web components.

It calls the web component begin and end methods if implemented, and provides access to the spec.

* `getServiceSpec(serviceName)` - retrieve the provisioner (service) section of the application.

The Mediator will call `begin()` and `end()` on the web component when the panel is set up and the Next button is hit during the install or uninstall flow.

### NavStation API

The NavStation API is injected into the settings web component.  It provides access to the application spec as well as a method to create a front end service client to access provisioner web APIs.

* `manifest` - the current application manifest
* `watchManifest(callback: (manifest) => void)` - watch for manifest changes, when changes, call callback with the updated manifest
* `patchManifest(patch)` - patch the manifest with the provided specification)
* `createService(provisionerService)` - create a feathers service client to the provisioner web API service specified.
