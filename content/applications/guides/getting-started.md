## A Kubernetes Cluster

A CodeZero cluster runs on Kubernetes
CodeZero (c6o) lets you create your own Cloud to host your applications. Your CodeZero Cloud is a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster enhanced with the CodeZero platform. Your cloud can run on the k8s provider of your choice: Digital Ocean, Amazon EKS, Google's GKE, Azure Kubernetes Service, or even bare metal.

This guide assumes you have no knowledge of operating a Kubernetes cluster, but understand how to create one, and download the Configuration file for the k8s cluster on your chosen provider. For more information on creating a cluster see the following for each provider:

* [Google GKE Setup]()
