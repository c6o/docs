## Using the Dashboard

### What you can do with the Dashboard App

The CodeZero dashboard is a visual way to help you debug your code and see what the CodeZero tool
is doing. In the dashboard you are able to:

1. Manage Kubernetes configuration files to access and switch between clusters
2. Access, run and manage CodeZero development profiles within CodeZero workspaces
3. Manage your user profile and how you appear to other developers
4. See what's running locally and in remote clusters and see other users that are using the CodeZero tool in remote clusters.
5. See a record of your debugging activity with the CodeZero tool.
