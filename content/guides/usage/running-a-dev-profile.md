# Running a Development Profile

*Development Profiles* are read from the `.codezero/develop/` directory within Workspaces. The following describes how to run a Development Profile.

1. Click on the CodeZero system tray icon.
2. Open the **Workspaces** menu and make sure you have the correct workspace selected.
3. Open the **Development Profiles** menu and select the profile you wish to run.

The Commands that are part of the Development Profile will start in sequence, and you will see various Sessions appear in the Dashboard as they start up.

You can run additional Development Profiles. They will start as long as there are no conflicting Sessions.
