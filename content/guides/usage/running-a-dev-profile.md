## Running a Development Profile

Development Profiles are read from the `.codezero/develop` directory and contain instructions to start up various CodeZero commands.

Open the dashboard window to see the sessions run from Development Profiles:

![Menu Dashboard](../../_media/app/tray-menu.png)

A dashboard opens, and if you have no sessions running, you will see a getting started page with documentation links.

![Getting Started](../../_media/app/dashboard-getting-started.png)

To run a Development Profile, select one from the "Development Profiles" menu items.

![Dev Profile](../../_media/app/run-dev-profile.png)

The command will start running and the dashboard will show a "busy" indicator while the session starts up:

![Empty Dashboard](../../_media/app/dashboard-empty-busy.png)

As commands run, you will see various sessions appear in the dashboard. When the command is finished you will see the
sessions that are running:

![Teleport](../../_media/app/dashboard-teleport.png)

Other Development Profiles can be run and these will show up too:

![Teleport Intercept](../../_media/app/dashboard-teleport-intercept.png)

A session is closed by selecting the close button next to the session:

![Close Teleport](../../_media/app/dashboard-close-teleport.png)

You can close all sessions by selecting the Close My Sessions button:

![Close Sessions](../../_media/app/dashboard-close-my-sessions.png)
