# Walkthough Demo

This guide will walk you through setting up a dummy application with several services,
and demonstrate using intercept and teleport to debug/develop the code.

## Overview

### Requirements

For this walk through you must have:
1. A Kubernetes Cluster with access to a valid kubeconfig.
1. The CodeZero CLI installed (see [getting started](../guides/getting-started) for more details)

### Teleport

TODO: example of using curl before and after with teleport

TODO: example getting configuration values and running service locally with appropriate config values
