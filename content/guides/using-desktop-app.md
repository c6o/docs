# Using the CodeZero Desktop App

## What you can do with the Desktop App

The Desktop App gives you a graphical interface for some of the functions available in the CLI.

With the app you can:

1. Merge `kubeconfig` contexts into your system's `kubeconfig` at `~/.kube/config`
2. Switch the active context
3. Securely request and share encrypted contexts with other users
4. Add _Workspaces_ containing _Development Profiles_ for easily running commands
5. Run _Development Profiles_ from your computer's system tray
6. See active _Sessions_ belonging to you or other users working in the cluster
7. Close running _Sessions_
8. See logs from _Sessions_ and previously run commands
9. Manage your user profile
